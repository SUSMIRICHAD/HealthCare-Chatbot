# Doctor Appointment Bot

A simple Python-based healthcare chatbot that assists users in booking doctor appointments. This bot helps patients find doctors, view available time slots, and register for appointments in different cities and departments.

## Features

- Select a hospital location from a predefined list of cities.
- Choose a department or browse through all available doctors.
- View available time slots for a chosen doctor.
- Register an appointment with a doctor and collect patient information.
- Handles both returning and new patients.

## How It Works

1. **Location Selection**: Users choose a hospital location from options like Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, etc.
2. **Department or Doctor Selection**: Users can choose a specific department (like Dermatology, Cardiologist, etc.) or browse available doctors if unsure.
3. **Doctor Appointment**: Once a doctor is selected, users can view available time slots and book an appointment.
4. **Patient Registration**: The bot collects patient details such as name, gender, date of birth, phone number, and email.
5. **Appointment Confirmation**: After booking, the bot confirms the appointment and the patient's registration.
